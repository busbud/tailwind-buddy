# Tailwind Buddy: Your Friendly Helper for Composing Tailwind Classes ðŸŽ¨

## What problem does Tailwind Buddy solve?

Tailwind Buddy addresses common challenges in managing Tailwind classes for complex, responsive designs. It offers a streamlined approach to:

- Organize and compose Tailwind classes for different component variants
- Handle responsive designs with ease, reducing potential screen flickering in SSR applications
- Manage compound variants that work responsively and can use custom props value
- Utilize a slot-based system for breaking down components into smaller, manageable parts
- Works well with nativewind

## Key Features

- Tools for building Tailwind variant components
- Support for responsive variant props
- Framework-agnostic solutions (works well with frameworks other than React)
- SSR-friendly class generation, both responsive and non-responsive
- React native + native windw friendly. It integrates really well with this stack.
- Ability to use slots for component composition
- Compound variants that work responsively, overriding classes based on variant values and other props
- High-performance variant utility. 5 times faster than tailwind variants and almost 2 times faster than CVA

This library is inspired by [CVA](https://cva.style/docs) and [tailwind-variants](https://github.com/nextui-org/tailwind-variants), offering our unique approach to solving common Tailwind challenges.
